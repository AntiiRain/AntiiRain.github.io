<h3 id="collaborative-graduation-project-milky-way-station">Collaborative Graduation Project: <em><strong>Milky Way Station</strong></em></h3>
<p><strong>Project Duration</strong>: December 2024 – Present<br>
<strong>Platform</strong>: Unity<br>
<strong>Programming Language</strong>: C#</p>
<p><strong>Milky Way Station</strong> is a 2D turn-based game set in a futuristic world where humanity has made contact with alien civilizations. As different factions vie for dominance, the game explores themes of unity and division in a technologically advanced galaxy. Players embark on a mission to uncover secrets within the ruins of the once-thriving Milky Way Station, navigating strategic combat and unraveling a compelling narrative.</p>

<h4 id="game-setting"><strong>Game Setting</strong></h4>
<p>In a future where Earth’s rapid technological progress has enabled communication with extraterrestrial species, humanity discovers a galactic network of advanced civilizations. While many aspire to build a brighter, more inclusive future, dissenters form hate-fueled organizations opposed to such ideals. These groups launch an attack on the Milky Way Station, a hub for interspecies cooperation. Years later, players explore the station’s ruins, uncovering its history while facing remnants of the conflict.</p>
<h4 id="my-role"><strong>My Role</strong></h4>
<p>As a programmer in this collaborative graduation project with students from the China Academy of Art, I contributed to both game design and development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-development Phase</strong>: Collaborated on determining the game’s type and designing its core gameplay mechanics, ensuring a cohesive vision for the project.</li>
<li><strong>Development Phase</strong>: Focused on programming, implementing key game functionalities, turn-based combat mechanics, and overall game logic using Unity.</li>
<li>Coordinated closely with the design team to ensure seamless integration of art assets and gameplay elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project has deepened my understanding of both creative and technical aspects of game development. It also provided valuable experience in interdisciplinary collaboration, combining technical programming with artistic design to create an engaging and meaningful gaming experience.</p>

<h3 id="visual-novel-march">Visual Novel: <em><strong>March</strong></em></h3>
<p><strong>Project Duration</strong>: June 2023 – Present<br>
<strong>Platform</strong>: Ren'Py 8.0<br>
<strong>Programming Language</strong>: Python 3</p>
<p><strong>March</strong> is a heartfelt visual novel set in the early 2000s, following the story of a middle school student preparing for their first major exam. Alongside the pressures of academic success and the resulting family tensions, the protagonist may encounter unexpected emotional developments. This collaborative project is a nostalgic and imaginative tribute to the experiences of Chinese middle school life. The script and scene direction have been completed, and the project is currently in the final stages of art development and optimization. The first chapter demo is set to launch on Steam soon.</p>
<p><strong>My Role</strong><br>
I took charge of project workflow management, ensuring smooth and timely development progress. I contributed to game design and conducted testing, leveraging my knowledge and experience in game development to improve the design. Additionally, I provided feedback to refine the script and enhance the overall narrative quality.</p>

<h3 id="engine-graphics-research-global-illumination-optimization-for-mobile"><strong>Engine Graphics Research: Global Illumination Optimization for Mobile</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Project Duration</strong>: January 2024 – June 2024<br>
<strong>Platform</strong>: Unreal Engine 5<br>
<strong>Programming Language</strong>: C++</p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong>: Tencent Games, IEG Department</p>
<p>This project focused on addressing global illumination (GI) leakage issues in mobile applications using Unreal Engine 5 and machine learning techniques. Under the guidance of a researcher from Tencent Games' IEG department, our team explored innovative solutions to optimize real-time rendering performance while mitigating light leakage artifacts, a key challenge in precomputed radiance transfer (PRT) workflows.</p>
<p><img src="https://AntiiRain.github.io/post-images/1734405301525.png" alt="" loading="lazy">light lingking hazard  compare with   Result Demonstration Image(right)</p>
<h4 id="my-role-2"><strong>My Role</strong></h4>
<p>I contributed to all stages of the project, including problem definition, data extraction, and performance optimization. My responsibilities included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extracting and preprocessing screen-space data (e.g., GBuffer information such as normals, positions, and albedo) using Unreal Engine 5’s APIs for model training.</li>
<li>Designing and evaluating various machine learning models (e.g., CNNs, decision trees) to predict spatial occlusions and mitigate light leakage issues.</li>
<li>Deploying the final CNN model on the GPU using HLSL and Compute Shaders, achieving an 88% reduction in inference time compared to initial approaches.</li>
<li>Visualizing and analyzing model performance, addressing prediction biases, and ensuring real-time application compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project not only allowed me to deepen my understanding of graphics rendering and machine learning but also demonstrated the potential of interdisciplinary approaches to solving complex real-time graphics challenges.</p>

<h3 id="comprehensive-graphics-practice">Comprehensive Graphics Practice</h3>
<p>I have a strong passion for computer graphics and have actively pursued self-directed learning in this field. In addition to my university courses, I have studied several renowned courses such as <em>GAMES101: Introduction to Computer Graphics</em> and <em>GAMES202: High-Quality Real-Time Rendering</em> from UCSB (taught by Professor Yan Lingqi). These courses helped me understand the fundamental concepts and methods of graphics.</p>
<p>Path Tracing Implementation Path Tracing Implementation:<br>
<img src="https://AntiiRain.github.io/post-images/1734405338113.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>I also further strengthened my theoretical foundation through the online courses <em>Mathematics for Computer Graphics</em> and <em>Graphics Development Tools</em> offered by Peking University. These resources have allowed me to grasp key rendering techniques, including Global Illumination (GI), ray tracing, and shadow implementation.</p>
<p>Through these studies, I gained a basic understanding of how game engines operate and how rendering pipelines work. Using frameworks from <em>GAMES101</em> and similar courses, I have written shaders and implemented rendering algorithms such as path tracing and BVH. These experiences showcase my programming skills and creativity in graphics.</p>
<p>I am eager to continue advancing my knowledge in computer graphics and apply this expertise to game rendering and development.</p>
